Little tool to bulk download windows updates by kb number.

Made it in order to automate work with 'System update readiness Tool' ( https://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821 ).

Tool will produce CheckSur.log file which can be used after editing it a little as a source of KB files list to download.

Updates list can have update names like:
